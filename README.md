# Time Series Prediction

Simple time series prediction using LSTM implemented with Pytorch.

* [RNN_sine_wave](RNN_sine_wave.ipynb) - This notebook deals with the methodology of Time Series prediction for a sine wave, a manually created synthetic dataset, using LSTM. (Residual)

* [RNN_sales](RNN_sales.ipynb) - This notebook deals with predicting sales of alcohol in the next year as a time series pattern. (Seasonal)

* [RNN_energy_production](RNN_energy_production.ipynb) - This notebook deals with predicting production of energy in the next year as a time series pattern. (Seasonal + Linear)
